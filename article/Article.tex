\begin{abstract}
\noindent
When an image is mostly composed of background pixels, most of the automatic
thresholding methods are failing to produce a relevant threshold. This is mainly
caused because one mode is over represented compared to the other in the histogram
of the image. The Kappa-Sigma clipping, a method largely used in astronomy, don't
try to separate 2 modes in the histogram, but rather try to find the properties of
the only usable mode, the one of the background, and compute a threshold to select
the values significantly different of the background.

\section{Description}
The images mostly formed of background pixels are not so common in biological 2D images.
However, the third dimension make this case a lot more common, and it's not rare to
have some images produced by a laser scanning confocal microscope which contain more than 90\%
of background pixels. The histogram of those images often appear to be mono-modal, as
the one shown in Figure~\ref{histogram}. The classical automatic thresholding methods
are trying to find a threshold which maximize the separation of (at least) two modes in
the histogram, and so are often performing badely when one mode is largely over represented
compared to the other.
